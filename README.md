# School_District_Analysis

##Purpose of project

#The purpose of this project is to analyze and change math + reading scores for Thomas High School. We are doing this to uphold the standards of state-testing by removing the scores with evidence of academic honesty for the grade 9’s.

##Results
#How is the district summary affected?
    - Decreased the number of students listed within the charter schools.

#How is the school summary affected?
    - The school summary is altered to drop all of the scores for grade 9’s at Thomas High School. 

#How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
    - Thomas High School’s performance relative to other schools’ performance is actually pretty consistent with the scores seen. In fact Thomas High School ranks      as one of the higher overall scoring schools.

# How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following
   - Math and reading scores by grade:
       - This changed the total scores of Thomas High School grade 9’s to be NaN scores. No change to other schools and/or districts.
   - Scores by school spending
       - School’s budget seems to allocate more funds per student vs. having all of the grade 9’s 
   - Scores by school size
       - Size dropped in value with the removal of grade 9’s at Thomas High School bringing the total output of students to 38709. 
   - Scores by school type
       - Not much change if any between District & Charter schools. If grade 9 scores were still integrated - may be a more positive result for Charter schools. 

#Summary of changes:
- Changed all values for grade 9 scores for Thomas Highschool
- Removed grade 9 total students from data frame
- Changed total school size for analyzing at Thomas High School
